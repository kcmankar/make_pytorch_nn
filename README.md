# CNN in pytorch 
This repository contains the code for making a covolutional neural network in pytroch to classify the images in coil20 dataset.
The dataset is available at <code>http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/software/softlib/coil-20.php</code>
<p>The data contains different images of 20 objects at various angles.</p>
<p>The goal is to classify all these 20 different objects using a convolutional neural network with the help of pytorch.
  </p><p> The test accuracy of the model is 85.98 % </p><p>
